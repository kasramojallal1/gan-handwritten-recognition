# GAN Handwritten Recognition

This project utilizes Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate and recognize handwritten digits. The primary goal is to train a GAN to produce realistic handwritten digits and then use these generated images to enhance the performance of a digit recognition model.

## Project Overview

The project consists of the following components:

1. **Handwritten Generator (`Handwritten Generator (GANs).ipynb`)**: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of the GAN model used to generate handwritten digits. It includes the training process, the architecture of the generator and discriminator, and visualization of generated digits.

2. **Utility Functions (`util.py`)**: This script includes various utility functions that support the main GAN training and evaluation process. These functions handle tasks such as data preprocessing, model evaluation, and result visualization.

## How It Works

1. **Data Preprocessing**: The input data, consisting of handwritten digit images, is preprocessed to a suitable format for the GAN model. This includes normalization and reshaping of the images.

2. **GAN Architecture**: The GAN consists of two main components:
   - **Generator**: The generator learns to produce realistic handwritten digits from random noise.
   - **Discriminator**: The discriminator evaluates the authenticity of the generated digits, distinguishing between real and fake images.

3. **Training Process**: The generator and discriminator are trained in a competitive setting, where the generator tries to fool the discriminator with increasingly realistic images, and the discriminator tries to correctly identify real and fake images.

4. **Evaluation**: The quality of the generated digits is evaluated using various metrics, and the best-performing models are selected based on their ability to produce realistic images.

5. **Recognition Model**: The generated handwritten digits are then used to augment the training data for a digit recognition model. This helps in improving the accuracy and robustness of the recognition model.

## Results

This project demonstrates the effectiveness of using GANs for generating realistic handwritten digits and enhancing digit recognition models. The key outcomes include:

- **Realistic Digit Generation**: The GAN successfully generates high-quality handwritten digits that are visually indistinguishable from real images.

- **Improved Recognition Accuracy**: Using the generated images to augment the training data leads to improved performance of the digit recognition model.

- **Robust Model**: The recognition model becomes more robust and accurate in recognizing handwritten digits, even with variations in writing styles.
